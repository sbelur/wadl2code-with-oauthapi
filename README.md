<b>Project DESCRIPTION</b><br/><br/><br/>
[Briefly - API Code generator with WADL as Input]



This project aims to generate APIs for methods defined in API definition file called WADL , where the rest end points are provided by a API provider like twitter 
allowing the user of the API to :
<li>
<ul>
a> make request to the target through Apigee Gateway thus gaining the benefit of OAuth Mediation
</ul>
<ul>
b> Taking the burden off the user from handling Authentication protocols like OAuth , thus hiding the complexity of oauth
from the end user.
</ul>
<ul>
The API generated by this library can be used for any provider as long as that provider is supported by Apigee gateway.(Mainly becuase of OAuth(or any custom protocol) mediation.
</ul>
<ul>
Provides a mechanism to learn about the APIs as well, without the user having to search/discover the individual end points,parameters and any other details.
</ul>
</li>

<br/>
<h2>Example</h2>
Example : [For Twitter - would be similar to other providers as well based on WADL inputs]
<pre>
<code snippet>

   Twitterstatusupdate twitterstatusupdate = new Twitterstatusupdate();
   twitterstatusupdate.setFormat(MethodConstants.XML_FORMAT);
   twitterstatusupdate.setStatus("hello world"+new Random().nextInt());
   System.out.println(twitterstatusupdate.invoke());	

</code snippet>
</pre>
