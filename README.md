<b>Project DESCRIPTION</b><br/>
[Briefly - API Code generator with WADL as Input]
<h2>Details</h2>


This project aims to generate APIs for methods defined in API definition file called WADL ,
where the rest end points are provided by a API provider like twitter allowing the user of the API to :
<li>
<ul>
make request to the target through Apigee Gateway thus gaining the benefit of OAuth Mediation
</ul>
<ul>
Taking the burden off the user from handling Authentication protocols like OAuth , thus hiding 
the complexity of oauth from the end user.
</ul>
<ul>
The API generated by this library can be used for any provider as long as that provider is supported
by Apigee gateway.(Mainly becuase of OAuth(or any custom protocol) mediation.
</ul>
<ul>
Provides a mechanism to learn about the APIs as well, without the user having to search/discover the 
individual end points,parameters and any other details.
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Example</h2>
Example : [For Twitter - would be similar to other providers as well based on WADL inputs]
<pre>
<code snippet>
   Statuseshome_timeline homeTimeline = new Statuseshome_timeline();
   homeTimeline.setSmartKey("application  user's smartkey");
   homeTimeline.setApplicationName("application name registered with apigee");
   homeTimeline.setFormat(MethodConstants.XML_FORMAT);
   String resp = homeTimeline.invoke();
</code snippet>
</pre>

<h2>Building</h2>
Please make sure you have maven installed in your machine.

Execute the following steps:
1. At the root level, mvn clean install
2. At the root level, mvn clean install -f apisdk-pom.xml
3. Jar should have been generated under apisdkgeneration/target/
4. Third party dependencies are under apisdkgeneration/target/lib

<h2>Running the Example After a build </h2>
1. Make sure you have all the jars (apisdkgeneration/target/ + apisdkgeneration/target/lib jars) in classpath
2. Compile and run your java/scala file with the above classpath.

<h2>TODO</h2>
1. Creating tests
2. Testing Testing Testing ....
